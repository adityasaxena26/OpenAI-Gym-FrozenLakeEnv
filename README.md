### Project: Frozen Lake Environment


In the FrozenLake environment, the agent navigates a 4x4 gridworld.

### The Dynamic Programming Setting
Environments in OpenAI Gym are designed with the reinforcement learning setting in mind. For this reason, OpenAI Gym does not allow easy access to the underlying one-step dynamics of the Markov decision process (MDP).

In order to use the FrozenLake environment for the dynamic programming setting, first clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
